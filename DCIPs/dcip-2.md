## Simple Summary

Agile Meeting, types, organization and incentives.


## Abstract

The Proposal is an extension from the DCF DAO Phase0 time measurements proposal to be implemented at the DCF DAO Phase1. There where DCF Agile mandatory meetings, but also some community request meetings and emergency or extra meetings online or even AFK at the foundation office. This proposal intends to Standarize the way meetings can be measured, whichones are mandatory and make them as more agile as possible.


## Motivation

To have more agile, responsable and organized meetings.

## Specification: meeting types, participant types and incentives 

### 1. Mandatory Meetings (Agile):

For the members which are asociated to the foundation, gets incentives by the foundation/projects and/or donates work, requires a constant comunication and organization, this members are responsable to attend **at least 75% and being active participant** of the mandatory meetings which are the following: 

The 60 min calls are on 19:00 Mexico City time are Mondays. Topics to perform:
* Review the last sprint tasks and approve the economic incentive by the DAO.
* Fill a balance Sheet/Table for each participant and his tasks with the project and total finished task added balance. 
* Asign task for the current sprint (week) between the team members and areas (currenty Administration and Development).
* Brainstorm an approach by consensus an estimate economic incentive for the tasks developers.

>Sprint tasks must be considered either as finished or functional. They should not be considered if they are partially done or something that is not proven to be functional.

The 15 min calls on 19:00 Mexico City time are Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. Topics: Communication, Syncronization and Support between the team on the workflow and tasks

The 25% of the whole payment is for attending to this meetings which is the biggest responsibility for our workflow and communication. So anyone involved into the workflow should be at least at 75% of the measured calls time (t).

$$ t >= 315min $$

Any skipped minute will be slashed from the total payment as following this equation:

$$ TP = TTD * \dfrac{MA}{t}$$ 

where: 

TP = Total Payment

TTD = Total Tasks Deliveries

MA = Minutes Attendance

t = Total of minutes calls for the month 
>**Currently monthly total calls time is 420 minutes**


##### Extra considerations:

1.1. There is also Right to change one 15 min call right monthly (24Hrs before)

1.2. If the Minutes Attendance /420 = 1; there should be a consideration or badge for attendance with a future reward.

1.3. If some one attends less or equal to 75% of the meetings unjustified there should be a quorum to propose a solution in regards the issue.

1.4. Proposed by Bleecker. If the mandatory call extends there should be an incentive based on the incentives model section. The extension can only be at maximum 50% extra from the original schueduled time, other way there should be a rescheduled call.

##### The only situation where we can skip Minutes Attendance are:

* Medical issues which require a justification proof (not always from the same source medic since it can be part of a corruption model).

### 2. Community Calls

2.1. Community calls should be approved by the DAO.

2.2. Community Calls that can ensure income to the foundation either economical or by community work donation should be considered for an incentive to the Participants 

2.3. Proposed by Bleecker. All comunity calls should have a total time scheduled, with no extra time added, the moderator and time set for the participants that will get incentives can be marked as active for the time they perform the community call.


### 3. Office or AFK Meetings
> All participants should be considered [`Active User`](#Active-User) since it is hard to fake out this type of meeting.

### Incentive and Participants types

**Justification**: Team Call incentives, meetings and others, should be consider more as simbolic since we are working on an already incentiviced tasks:

1. We do not want to promote useless long calls following the agile methodologies, 
2. Incentives must not be too big but enough to promote teamwork, this is a proposed price to each individual (per hour on a specific task).
3. On mandatory calls unattendance or missing minutes attendance users should not be include into the incentive extra time.

#### Participative User 
incentive: 1.4USD Hour. 

> Note: To review how to verify participative person

#### Active User 
Mostly a Speaker/ Moderator 
incentive: 6USD Hour.


#### How to verify Participance?

##### Random Ping Pong verification
Proposed model by p1r0 where the Moderator ask random time random participation cuestion to random asistend to consider elegible to participative incentive.

## Implementation

DCF Phase0 Proposal was already implemented and tested while we found multiple issues that
